# This Recipe should only be run in a development environment because
# it installs MySQL locally, and adjusts a few MySQL settings.
# Please use the default recipe in combination with the database recipe
# if you need to create a database and user for GWM

# Make sure our settings in Django are set correctly to mysql
node.override['ganeti_webmgr']['database']['engine'] = 'mysql'
# install mysql server
include_recipe "mysql::server"

directory node['mysql']['data_dir'] do
  mode "0755"
end

# Run the rest of our setup for GWM
include_recipe "ganeti_webmgr::default"
